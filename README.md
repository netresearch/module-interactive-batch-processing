Netresearch Interactive Batch Processing Extension
==================================================

The Netresearch Interactive Batch Processing Extension adds a confirmation step
to the _Create Shipments_ mass action.

Description
-----------

The Netresearch shipping framework offers shipment batch processing in the
Magento orders grid. In this process, the shipping settings used to book a
shipping label are read from the central module configuration. However, booking
all selected orders with the same settings may not be desired. This module
allows to configure the packaging and shipping product per order before running
the batch process.
